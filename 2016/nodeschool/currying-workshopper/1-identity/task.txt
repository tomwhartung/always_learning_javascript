 Currying in JavaScript
────────────────────────
 IDENTITY
 Exercise 1 of 6

Write a function that takes an argument, returns that argument.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## HINTS

To make a Node.js program, create a new file with a .js extension and start writing JavaScript! Execute your program by running it with the
node command. e.g.:

    $ node program.js

Writing function to be available for outer world is different in node. You need to export your function like:

    var identity = function (args) {
        //your code
    };
    module.exports = identity;

Node module is beyound scope of this exercise. However if you are interested, there is great blog on node module exports: [http://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-module-exports-exports-node-js].

When you are done, you must run:

    $ curry verify program.js

to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.

 » To print these instructions again, run: curry print
 » To execute your program in a test environment, run: curry run program.js
 » To verify your program, run: curry verify program.js
 » For help run: curry help
