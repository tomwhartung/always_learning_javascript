# codecademy

Checking in my codecademy code for future reference, e.g., on another computer, should that become something we want to do.

* The codecademy site is at [codecademy.com](http://codecademy.com/).

## Why?

Adding in all the files created recently during the initial codecademy work I did.

Note that these files are incomplete and will not work on their own.

Rather they allowed me to save off code (because sometimes it would disappear and I would have to start over) and work with it in vi (because sometimes it is nice to search for things and possibly find typoes that way, or figure out that the issue is not a typoe, but rather something else).

Look for more additions in the immediate future.
