Directives I

Add new js/directives/appInfo.js (and include in index.html):

app.directive('appInfo', function() { 
  return { 
    restrict: 'E',   // 'E' for element
    scope: {
      info: '='      // look for "info=..."
    }, 
    templateUrl: 'js/directives/appInfo.html' 
  }; 
});

Add new js/directives/appInfo.html :

<img class="icon" ng-src="{{ info.icon }}"> 
<h2 class="title">{{ info.title }}</h2> 
<p class="developer">{{ info.developer }}</p> 
<p class="price">{{ info.price | currency }}</p>

Update index.html to use the new directive:

<div class="card">
	<app-info info="move"></app-info>
</div>

Directives II

We wrote code to teach the browser a new HTML element <app-info>, and used it in the view to display each app's details.

First in js/directives/appInfo.js, we made a new directive. We used app.directive to create a new directive named 'appInfo'. It returns an object with three options:

1. "restrict" specifies how the directive will be used in the view. The 'E' means it will be used as a new HTML element.

2. "scope" specifies that we will pass information into this directive through an attribute named info.
   The = tells the directive to look for an attribute named info in the <app-info> element, like this:

     <app-info info="shutterbugg"></app-info>

    The data in info becomes available to use in the template given by templateURL.

3. "templateUrl" specifies the HTML to use in order to display the data in scope.info.
   Here we use the HTML in js/directives/appInfo.html.

Looking at js/directives/appInfo.html, we define the HTML to display details about an app, like its title and price.
We use expressions and filters to display the data.

Why is creating your own directives useful?

o Readability. Directives let you write expressive HTML. Looking at index.html you can understand the app's behavior just by reading the HTML.
o Reusability. Directives let you create self-contained units of functionality. We could easily plug in this directive into another AngularJS app and avoid writing a lot of repetitive HTML.

<div class="card">
	<app-info info="forecast"></app-info>
</div>

Built-in and Custom Directives

1. Add data to controller:
  $scope.apps = [ 
  { 
    icon: 'img/move.jpg', 
    title: 'MOVE', 
    developer: 'MOVE, Inc.', 
    price: 0.99 
  }, 
  { 
    icon: 'img/shutterbugg.jpg', 
    title: 'Shutterbugg', 
    developer: 'Chico Dusty', 
    price: 2.99 
  },
  ....

2. Replace individual cards with one that uses ng-repeat

   <div class="card" ng-repeat="app in apps">
      <app-info info="app"></app-info>
   </div>

InstallApp I

New Directive:

app.directive('installApp', function() {
	return {
		restrict: 'E',   // 'E' for element
		scope: { },
		templateUrl: 'js/directives/installApp.html',
		link: function(scope, element, attrs) {
			scope.buttonText = "Install",
			scope.installed = false,
			scope.download = function() { 
				element.toggleClass('btn-active'); 
				if(scope.installed) {
					scope.buttonText = "Install";
					scope.installed = false;
				} else {
					scope.buttonText = "Uninstall";
					scope.installed = true;
				} 
			}
		}
	};
});

InstallApp II

Adding js/directives/installApp.html :

<button class="btn btn-active" ng-click="download()"> 
  {{ buttonText }} 
</button>

--

InstallApp III

Add to index.html:

<div class="main" ng-controller="MainController">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="card" ng-repeat="app in apps">
      <app-info info="app"></app-info>
      <install-app> </install-app>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Generalizations

    Directives are a powerful way to create self-contained, interactive components. Unlike jQuery which adds interactivity as a layer on top of HTML, AngularJS treats interactivity as a native component of HTML.
