Notes from going through lesson 0 of this reactjs tutorial:

- [ReactJS Tutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)

# 1. My Setup for the tutorial

The tutorial wants me to build this on a website named CodeSandbox.
I won't be doing that.

I will be building this on my localhost in `/var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/reactjs/projects`.

## Commands Run

```
$ pwd
/var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/reactjs/projects
$ npx create-react-app tic-tac-toe-app

Success! Created tic-tac-toe-app at /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/reactjs/projects/tic-tac-toe-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd tic-tac-toe-app
  npm start

Happy hacking!
$ cd tic-tac-toe-app/
$ npm start
$
```
