Notes from going through lesson 0 of this reactjs tutorial:

- [ReactJS Tutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)

# 1. Setup for `my_way` of Doing the Tutorial

The tutorial wants me to build this on a website named CodeSandbox.
I won't be doing that.

I will be building this `my_way` version of the tic-tac-toe project on my localhost by working in
`/var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/reactjs/projects/ttt-my_way-app`.

## Parallel Development

I will also be going through this in a parallel `their_way` version of the project, following the process
they suggest for working on my localhost.

See the file `2b-tic_tac_toe-their_way` in this directory for details about that effort.

## Commands Run

```
$ pwd
/var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/reactjs/projects
$ npx create-react-app ttt-my_way-app
Creating a new React app in /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/reactjs/projects/ttt-my_way-app.
