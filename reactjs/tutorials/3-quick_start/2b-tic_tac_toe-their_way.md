Notes from going through lesson 0 of this reactjs tutorial:

- [ReactJS Tutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)

# 1. Setup for the tutorial

This section describes my efforts to setup the project for **`their_way`** of doing the tutorial.

The tutorial wants me to build this on a website named CodeSandbox.
I won't be doing that.

Their alternative, under *Setup for the tutorial* and in a **Note** box, **for using my local development environment,**
is to download the CodeSandbox files.

I will be building this `their_way` version of the tic-tac-toe project on my localhost in
`/var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/reactjs/projects`.

## 1.1. Parallel Development

I will also be going through this in a parallel `my_way` version of the project, following a process
that makes more sense to me - because I'll learn more about `npm`, structuring the project, etc. - for working on my localhost.

See the file `2a-tic_tac_toe-my_way` in this directory for details about that effort.

## 1.2. Process for `their_way` of Developing on My Localhost

This process is a summarization of the process given in the **Note** box under
[*Setup for the tutorial*](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe#setup-for-the-tutorial).

1. Install `Node.js`
2. Export a zip file downloaded from CodeSandbox
3. Unzip the downloaded file and `cd` into that directory
4. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
5. Run `npm start` and "follow the prompts to view the code running in a browser"

It all sounds too pat and easy, hence the desire to also do it `my_way`!

## 1.3. Steps Taken and Commands Run

**Note:** Taking these steps leads to a version that fails to compile.
Feel free to skip ahead!

However, I think most of these steps are necessary, and that we might be on the right track....

### 1.3.1. Install `Node.js`

Already done!

### 1.3.2. Download the Zip File

Too easy!

### 1.3.3. Unzip the Zip File and `cd`

Working on this version of the project in
`/var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/reactjs/projects/ttt-their_way`.

Keeping a copy of the downloaded file in
`var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/reactjs/projects/downloads/codesandbox`.

```
pwd   # /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/reactjs/projects
mkdir -p downloads/reactjs/
cd downloads/reactjs/
mv  ~/Downloads/i18f1x.zip .
unzip i18f1x.zip .
cd ../..
mkdir ttt-their_way-app
l  ttt-their_way-app/
cp downloads/codesandbox/i18f1x.zip ttt-their_way-app/
cd  ttt-their_way-app/
l
unzip i18f1x.zip
l
```

### 1.3.4. Run `npm install`

Commands run:

```
$ pwd
/var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/reactjs/projects/ttt-their_way-app/
$ npm install
npm WARN deprecated urix@0.1.0: Please see https://github.com/lydell/urix#deprecated
npm WARN deprecated source-map-url@0.4.1: See https://github.com/lydell/source-map-url#deprecated
. . .
. . .
. . .
npm WARN deprecated core-js@2.6.12: core-js@<3.23.3 is no longer maintained and not recommended for usage due to the number of issues. Because of the V8 engine whims, feature detection in old core-js versions could cause a slowdown up to 100x even if nothing is polyfilled. Some versions have web compatibility issues. Please, upgrade your dependencies to the actual version of core-js.

### 1.3.5. Run `npm start`

```
$ pwd
/var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/reactjs/projects/ttt-their_way-app/
$ npm start
Failed to compile.

./src/App.js

$
```

Opens new browser tab for url
[http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/)
because I am already using port 3000 for the `my_way` app.

The new browser tab says:

Well, that was unexpected!

At the end of the **Note** box, it says:

> If you get stuck, donâ€™t let this stop you! Follow along online instead and try a local setup again later.

Thinking I might, *might,* try fixing this error.
*Maybe!*

Let me think about it....

## 1.4. Files Edited - First try

**Note:** Taking these steps apparently just makes things worse!
Feel free to skip ahead to the next section, *1.5. Files Edited - Second try.*

Tried editing `src/App.js` to fix the error above:

```
$ gd src/App.js
diff --git a/reactjs/projects/ttt-their_way-app/src/App.js b/reactjs/projects/ttt-their_way-app/src/App.js

+    </div>
   );
 }
```

This caused a slew of other errors:

```

## 1.5. Files Edited - Second Try - Another Failed Attempt

In `2a-tic_tac_toe-my_way.md` it was easy enough to get the minimal, 3-line version of `App.js` presented in the code box in the
[Setup for the tutorial](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe#setup-for-the-tutorial) subsection.
Let's give that a try!

- Saved a copy of the current version of `App.js` as `App-the_whole_shebang-fails_to_compile.js`
- Replaced all of with the minimal, 3-line version of `App.js` that appears in the following code snipped

```javascript
export default function Square() {
  return <button className="square">X</button>;
}
```

Rats!  This resulted in the following error:

```
./src/App.js
  Line 4:  'React' must be in scope when using JSX  react/react-in-jsx-scope
```

Which might be considered slightly better than the **21 similar errors** seen above.

**Note:** Went ahead and checked in this change.

## 1.6. Files Edited - Third Try - More Failed Attempts

Comparing the version of `index.js` in `ttt-my_way-app/src` to the version of `index.js` in `ttt-their_way-app/src`,
I tried making the following edits to `ttt-their_way-app/src/index.js`:

- Added the line `import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';` as line 2
  - This did not help
  - Commented out the line but left it in the new file `src/index-failed_attempts_to_fix_the_errors.js`
    - Don't want to waste time trying this "fix" again
    - Who knows, it might come in handy in the future
- Tried these two edits, based on what I see in `ttt-my_way-app/src/index.js`:
  - Updated line 10 (formerly line 9) from `<StrictMode>` to `<React.StrictMode>`
  - Updated line 12 (formerly line 11) from `</StrictMode>` to `</React.StrictMode>`
  - This did not help
  - Left these two "non-fixes" in the new file `src/index-failed_attempts_to_fix_the_errors.js`
    - I don't believe they will hurt anything, but want to be safe.

**Note:** Checked in the new file `src/index-failed_attempts_to_fix_the_errors.js` for possible future reference.

Following is the difference between the two `index*.js` files:

```
$ pwd
/var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/reactjs/projects/ttt-their_way-app
$ diff src/index.js src/index-failed_attempts_to_fix_the_errors.js
1a2
> // import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
9c10
<   <StrictMode>
---
>   <React.StrictMode>
11c12
<   </StrictMode>
---
>   </React.StrictMode>
$
```

**Putting this version on hold for the time being.**
