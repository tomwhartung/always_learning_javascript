Notes from going through this reactjs tutorial:

- [ReactJS Quick Start](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn)

The goal is to *not* dwell on things I already learned in going through the previous tutorials.

# 0. Creating a New React App

I am creating a new react app so I can play around with some of these ideas and topics.

## Commands Run

```
$ pwd
/var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/reactjs/projects
$ npx create-react-app my-quick-start-app
Creating a new React app in /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/reactjs/projects/my-quick-start-app.

Success! Created my-quick-start-app at /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/reactjs/projects/my-quick-start-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd my-quick-start-app
  npm start

Happy hacking!
$
npm run start
Compiled successfully!

You can now view my-quick-start-app in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://10.0.1.113:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.

webpack compiled successfully

```

## Files Edited

Edited the following files, to get rid of some of the "cutesy stuff" etc., before starting to play around:

- my-quick-start-app/public/index.html
  - Changed the title
- my-quick-start-app/src/App.js
  - Replaced default "cutesy stuff" with my own message
