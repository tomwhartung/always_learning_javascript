Notes from going through this reactjs tutorial:

- [ReactJS Quick Start](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn)

The goal is to *not* dwell on things I already learned in going through the previous tutorials.

# 0. Creating a New React App

I am creating a new react app so I can play around with some of these ideas and topics.

## Commands Run

```
$ pwd
/var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/reactjs/projects
$ npx create-react-app my-quick-start-app
Creating a new React app in /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/reactjs/projects/my-quick-start-app.

Run `npm audit` for details.

Success! Created my-quick-start-app at /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/reactjs/projects/my-quick-start-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd my-quick-start-app
  npm start

Happy hacking!
$
npm run start
Compiled successfully!

You can now view my-quick-start-app in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://10.0.1.113:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.

webpack compiled successfully
$
```

## Files Edited

Edited the following files, to get rid of some of the "cutesy stuff" etc., before starting to play around:

- my-quick-start-app/public/index.html
  - Changed the title
- my-quick-start-app/src/App.js
  - Replaced default "cutesy stuff" with my own message


# Quick Start

Noting just the **important** stuff!

## 1. Creating and Nesting Components

- React component names *must* start with an upper case letter
- HTML elements *must* be all lower case

## 2. Writing markup with JSX

- JSX is stricter than HTML
  - For example, you must close tags, e.g., `<br />`
- You can use an [online converter](https://transform.tools/html-to-jsx) to convert HTML to JSX

## 3. Adding styles

- Use the `className` attribute to specify CSS classes for your components
  - In JSX, the `className` attribute **replaces** the HTML `class` attribute

## 4. Displaying data

- Use curly braces to "escape back" into JavaScript and embed a bit of data

```javascript
  <h1>
    {user.name}
  </h1>
```

- Use curly braces *instead of* double quotes to specify a JavaScript value as an HTML attribute
  - In these cases it's ok to use "complex expressions" such as string concatenation

```javascript
  <img
    className="avatar"
    src={user.imageUrl}
    alt={'Photo of ' + user.name}
  />
```

## 5. Conditional rendering

- It's ok to use regular old JavaScript `if {...} else {...}` statements in JSX

```javascript
let content;
if (isLoggedIn) {
  content = <AdminPanel />;
} else {
  content = <LoginForm />;
}
```

- To use the ternary conditional operator `... ? ... : ...', put it inside curly braces

```javascript
  {isLoggedIn ? (
    <AdminPanel />
  ) : (
    <LoginForm />
  )}
```

- If you don't need an `else`, you can use the logical `&&` operator inside curly braces

```javascript
  {isLoggedIn && <AdminPanel />}
```
