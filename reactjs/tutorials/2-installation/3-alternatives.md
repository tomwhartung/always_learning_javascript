Alternative ways to get started on a new react project.

# Alternatives

These are alternative ways to get started, based on the references I'm using:

- React docs [Start a New React Project](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/start-a-new-react-project)
  - Limited: [HTML file and a script tag](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/add-react-to-a-website)
    - This technique involves adding React to an existing site
    - This technique doesn't involve node
    - I won't be taking this option at this time
  - Building with a full-featured framework
    - I won't be taking this option at this time
  - Popular alternatives
    - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)
    - [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/getting-started/webapp/)
    - I won't be taking these options at this time
  - Custom toolchains
    - I won't be taking these options at this time
- My new *Road to React* e-book
  - The author supplies a link to his [developer setup](https://www.robinwieruch.de/developer-setup/) page
    - This page gives an overview of the process
    - Here he links to other pages detailing how to install the following on MacOS and Windows
      - How to install nodejs and npm
      - How to install Visual Studio
      - There may be more, I am not digging into this at this time
    - I won't be taking this option at this time
  - The author also recommends using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
    - Not digging in too deeply, it looks like he uses this to set up the code
    - I won't be taking this option at this time

Just listing these here for possible future reference.
