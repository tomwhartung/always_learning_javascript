How to install the basics.

# References

Available references seem to be written for newbies using Windows and Mac OS.
As an experienced linux-lover, it seems I am on my own here, frankensteining things at best.

# node and npm

Used the Discover Software Center app to install `node` and `npm`.

So far, so good.
