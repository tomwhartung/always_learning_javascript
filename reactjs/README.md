# Getting Back to Learning ReactJs

Ok!  Apparently covid won't kill me - at least as long as I live like I'm a recluse - so let's do this!

# URLs

Online sites I am using for getting started.

## ReactJs.org

Starting with the [ReactJs.org](https://reactjs.org) site:

- [ReactJs.org Step-by-Step Guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)
  - Completed this tutorial on Jan. 29, 2023!
  - Code is in my [Reactjs step-by-step tutorial code collection](https://codepen.io/collection/zxpgmM) on codepen

There are two versions of the next tutorial on the site

- The older one: [ReactJs.org Hands-on Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
- The newer one: [ReactJs.org Tutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)

I will try starting with the newer one, and stick with it *as long as it's not too too bad.*

**Note:** because the newer one is in beta, by the time you read this, the link to it might change!!

## References for JS

Got these links from the pages above:

- [MDN guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_Overview)
- [JS6 tips](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/683e676101005de0add59e8bb345340c)

## Other Tutorials

Maybe try one or more of these later?

- [W3 Schools React Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/react/default.asp)
- [Tutorials Point React Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/reactjs/index.htm)
  - Warning: this one sometimes eats up memory (maybe some errant ad code, that will be fixed later?)
