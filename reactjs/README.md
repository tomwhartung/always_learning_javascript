# Getting Back to Learning ReactJs

Ok!  Apparently covid won't kill me - at least as long as I live like I'm a recluse - so let's do this!

## URLs

Online sites I am using for getting started.

### ReactJs.org

Starting with the [ReactJs.org](https://reactjs.org) site:

- [ReactJs.org Step-by-Step Guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)
- [ReactJs.org Hands-on Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

### References for JS

Got these links from the pages above:

- [MDN guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_Overview)
- [JS6 tips](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/683e676101005de0add59e8bb345340c)
