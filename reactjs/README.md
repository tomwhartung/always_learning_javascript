# Getting Back to Learning ReactJs

Ok!  Apparently covid won't kill me - at least as long as I live like I'm a recluse - so let's do this!

# URLs

Online sites I am using for getting started.

## ReactJs.org

It makes sense to start with this page on the [ReactJs.org](https://reactjs.org) site:

- [https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

### Step-by-Step Guide

I picked this Step-by-Step Guide because the getting started page stated it was the one to pick
"If you prefer to **learn concepts step by step.**"

- [ReactJs.org Step-by-Step Guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)
  - Completed this tutorial on Jan. 29, 2023!
  - Code is in my [Reactjs step-by-step tutorial code collection](https://codepen.io/collection/zxpgmM) on codepen

Note that the last page in the Step-by-Step Guide is
[Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html).

> Many React users credit reading Thinking in React as the moment React finally “clicked” for them. It’s probably the oldest React walkthrough but it’s still just as relevant.

There is also a page called
[Thinking in React - beta version](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/thinking-in-react)
in the new docs.
It looks to be very similar, albeit maybe a little more colorful.

#### TODO? Advanced Guides

The [ReactJs.org Step-by-Step Guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) includes a whole section
of Advanced Guides.

**TODO:** consider going through these later.

### Learn React

For those who "prefer to **learn by doing**", the
[https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
page links to a [practical tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

There are two versions of this tutorial on the site:

- The original [practical tutorial aka. "Hands-on Tutorial"](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
- The newer [ReactJs.org Tutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)
  - This is under Quick Start on the [home page for the new docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn)

Both of these build a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

I will try starting with the newer one, and stick with it *as long as it's not too too bad.*
At this time, the site says the new docs are 99% complete, so we should be fine.

### But First: Installation

I am anxious to start running this code locally, so it makes sense to install everything I need on my laptop.

Hopefully the first page in the new docs, which is on [Installation](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/installation),
will get me there.


## References for JS

Got these links from the pages above:

- [MDN guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_Overview)
- [JS6 tips](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/683e676101005de0add59e8bb345340c)

## Other Tutorials

Maybe try one or more of these later?

- [W3 Schools React Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/react/default.asp)
- [Tutorials Point React Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/reactjs/index.htm)
  - Warning: this one sometimes eats up memory (maybe some errant ad code, that will be fixed later?)
