Listing the steps needed to install and setup VSCode for use with Reactjs and TypeScript.

# 1. Installation on Ubuntu

## 1.1. References

Both of these sites:

- [phoenixnap.com/kb/install-vscode-ubuntu](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-vscode-ubuntu)
- [linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-visual-studio-code-on-ubuntu-20-04/](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-visual-studio-code-on-ubuntu-20-04/)

offer these two methods for installing VSCode:

(1) Install the VSCode `snap`
  - A large package contains everything
(2) Install Using `apt`
  - The IDE shares dependencies with the rest of the OS

For an overview of the difference between these two hoptins, see
[phoenixnap.com/kb/snap-vs-apt](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/snap-vs-apt).

I am picking option (2).
