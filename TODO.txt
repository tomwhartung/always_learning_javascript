Review:
  getStoredScoreValues in jungian/LocalStorageLib.tsx
    - Returns a single initialScoreValue
    - We no longer check the length of the scoreValues array
      - That was a hack, remember?
   - Should be ok to change this to ...???
   - Not wanting to mess with this now...   

Review:
  Review code on all pages:
    [x] lib/JungianLib.tsx
      [x] Check for unnecessary code, e.g., console.log statements
      [x] Check for unnecessarily-exported functions

    [ ] Create page
      [ ] Check event handlers and useEffect() calls on all pages:
        [ ] Check for consistency, esp. in First useEffect()
      [ ] Check for unnecessary code, e.g., console.log statements
      [ ] Check for clarity
      [ ] Check for unnecessary state variables - could be scary!

Rename:
  ??? imageStringToDraw ???
    Tried adding "ToDraw" to squareSize, gridSize, and even the score ...
      ... BUT that did not work out very well
