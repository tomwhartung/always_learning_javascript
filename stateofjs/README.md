# stateofjs/README.md

Took a look at the [State of JS site for 2022](https://stateofjs.com/en-us/)
and think it's worthwhile to dig deeper and make some notes about some of the contents.

# Features

The [stateofjs site](https://stateofjs.com/en-us/) includes a
[list of features](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/features/), many of which I am not familiar with.
Each of these contain a link to the relevant page on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).

The [stateofjs features page](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/features/) contains the following types of features:

- Features of the JS language
- Features of browser APIs
- Other features

This seems like a good time to take a look at each of these, at least briefly, so I can come back to them if I want to use them.

Look for notes about these features in the `features` subdirectory.
