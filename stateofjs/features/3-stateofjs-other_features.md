# 1. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

Here are some notes from
[MDN's page describing *progressive Web Apps*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps).

## Overview

Note: The page linked to above provides only a high-level overview with links to more detailed information.
It does not even *define* the following terms!

Progressive web apps enable web application developers to provide users with
[Progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement).
This means providing base functionality to all users, then increasingly sophisticated functionality to
users who have the hardware needed to support it.

Some essential elements of progressive enhancement are:

- [Feature detection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Feature_detection)
  - The ability to determine whether the user's browser supports the features a given block of code needs to run
- [Polyfills](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill)
  - JavaScript code that can mimic the new capabilities of more modern browsers in older browsers that lack these capabilities
  - Older versions of jQuery were early examples in that they provided developers with cross-browser functionality

## Description

[MDN's introduction to PWAs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Introduction)
provides an additional level of detail about them:

Following are some of the principles progressive web apps should follow:

- [Discoverability](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Introduction#discoverability)
  - Enable search engines to discover the web page's contents
- [Installability](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Introduction#installability)
  - Enable the page to be made available on the home screen or app launcher of a device
- [Linkability](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Introduction#linkability)
  - Enables users to share it by sending its URL
- [Network independence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Introduction#network_independence)
  - Enables users to continue using the app even when the network connection is poor or non-existent
- [Hardware flexibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Introduction#progressive_enhancement_support)
  - Supports older browers while also utilizing the new features that modern browsers provide
- [Re-engageablility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Introduction#re-engageability)
  - Able to let users know when new content is available
- [Device independence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Introduction#responsiveness)
  - Able to work on a variety of device types, from phones, laptops, TVs, to even appliances such as refridgerators
- [Secure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Introduction#secure)
  - Able to keep sensitive data private from third parties who lack permission to see it

## TODO

Look into all this when I have the inclination to, and more time to do so.
The [MDN page for *progressive Web Apps*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)
is a good place to *start.*
