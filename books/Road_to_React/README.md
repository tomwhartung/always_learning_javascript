# Road to React

Some of the more salient points gleaned from the book:

* Road to React by Robin Wieruch

**Are *NOT* in this directory!**

Because the author starts off using vite, at this point most of those notes are in:

- `vite/notes/1-rtr-fundamentals_of_react.md`,
- `vite/notes/2-rtr-typescript_in_react.md`, and
- `vite/notes/2a-rtr-typescript_in_react-troubleshooting.md`

Enjoy!
