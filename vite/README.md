# vite/README.md

This is the `README.md` file for the `vite` directory in the `always_learning_javascript` repository.

**Note:** Following the Plans are things that I've actually *1. Done*, and then some things I want *2. To-Do Next* -
unless I've done them already.

# 0. Plans

## 0.1. Learning Vite

The plan is to go ahead and try it out with Reactjs.

- See the section *Setting up a React Project* in the chapter *Fundamentals of React* in the *Road to React* e-book

## 0.2. Working Towards `the_whole_shebang`

This means adding in [MDB](https://mdbootstrap.com).


# 1. `1-rtr-fundamentals_of_react` Project

Notes for the `projects/1-rtr-fundamentals_of_react/hacker-stories/` project are in
`notes/1-rtr-fundamentals_of_react.md`.

## 1.1. Overview of the `1-rtr-fundamentals_of_react` Project

- Based on the *Setting up a React Project* section in the *Fundamentals of React* chapter of the *Road to React* e-book
- First try at using `vite` to set up a project on my local machine
- Contains some detailed notes about `vite`
  - Important files
  - Configuration basics
- Includes a first look at how to use ESLint
  - Configuration basics

**Note:** Right now I am focused on learning to use `vite`, and I did not go through all the steps of updating the app as
outlined in the *Road to React* e-book.

## 1.2. Lessons Learned From the `1-rtr-fundamentals_of_react` Project

- It is safe to use `vite`
- Others recommend it, including at least one speaker at the Reactathon last week
- My `create-react-app` in the `typescript` broke somehow
  - This app still runs, so that's cool


# 2. `2-rtr-typescript_in_react` Project

Notes for the `projects/2-rtr-typescript_in_react/ts_in_react-1` project are in
`notes/2-rtr-typescript_in_react.md`.

## 2.1. Overview of the `1-rtr-fundamentals_of_react` Project

- Based on notes from the *Typescript in React* section in the *React Maintenance* chapter of the *Road to React* e-book
- Started with `vite@latest` setup with `--template react`
- Add ESLint

- Add typescript
- Make updates per the *TypeScript in React* section of *React Maintenance* chapter of the *Road to React* ebook:
  - Rename `.jsx` files to `.tsx`
  - Add TS config files
- Test drive VSCode
  - See how things look in it
- Generate a TS error
- Generate an ESLint error


### 2.2. Lessons Learned From the `2-rtr-typescript_in_react` Project
**TBD**


# 3. `XXX` Project

**The goal is to build the `whole_shebang`.**

- 3-vite_mdb_only
  - See [MDB 5 Vite Integration](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/getting-started/vite-integration/)
- 4-react_mdb_only
- 5-whole_shebang
  - react, typescript, eslint, mdb

**REMEMBER:**

- Be sure to keep `whole_shebang/notes/1-whole_shebang-commands.md` updated with any and all commands run
- Ultimately `whole_shebang/projects/1-whole_shebang` should be as minimal as possible
  - Work out all issues *here*
