# README.md

This is the `README.md` file for the `vite` directory in the `always_learning_javascript` repository.

**Note:** Following the Plans are things that I've actually *1. Done*, and then some things I want *2. To-Do Next* -
unless I've done them already.

# 0. Plans

## 0.1. Learning Vite

The plan is to go ahead and try it out with Reactjs.

- See the section *Setting up a React Project* in the chapter *Fundamentals of React* in the *Road to React* e-book

## 0.2. Working Towards `the_whole_shebang`

This means adding in [MDB](https://mdbootstrap.com).

- See [MDB 5 Vite Integration](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/getting-started/vite-integration/)

**Plan:**

1. Try mdb by itself
2. Try out mdb with react
3. ???
4. Profit!
