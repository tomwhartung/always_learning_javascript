Taking a break from React, TS, and attempting to get ESLint to work with them, it's time to
*use `vite` to install mdbootstrap* and see what happens.

# My MDB Adventure!

The adventure starts with
[MDB's Bootstrap 5 & React 18 demo page](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/react/#demo).

# Projects

- [x] 1. Use `vite` to install mdbootstrap
  - From [mdb's download page](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/react/getting-started/installation/)
  - Notes are in `4a-just_mdboostrap.md` in this directory
  - Project is in `vite/projects/4-my_mdb_adventure/1-mdb_unzipped`

- [x] 2. Add TypeScript to MDB's `MDB5-REACT-UI-KIT-Free-6.0.0`
  - Notes are in `4b-mdb_and_ts.md` in this directory
  - Project is in `vite/projects/4-my_mdb_adventure/2-mdb_and_ts`
  - **This Failed**
    - This totally broke `npm install`
    - Did not break the App but ... it is obviously unacceptable in its current state
