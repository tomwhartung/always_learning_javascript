At the very end of this page, the tutorial recommends renaming this directory, so that is what I will do:

```
$ pwd
/var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/vite/projects/4-my_mdb_adventure/4c-mdb_cli-mdbootstrap
$ mv mdb5-free-standard mdb-uikit-tutorial
$ gs .

# Page 4: [Create a Portfolio](https://mdbootstrap.com/learn/mdb-foundations/mdb-ui-kit/create-portfolio/)

- [x] Visited link to demo we will be creating: [ascensus-mdb-uikit-tutorial.mdbgo.io](https://ascensus-mdb-uikit-tutorial.mdbgo.io/)
- [x] Added basic structure code to `index.html`

# Page 5: [Split screen](https://mdbootstrap.com/learn/mdb-foundations/mdb-ui-kit/split-screen/)

I am not going to go through these steps, but I think it is worthwhile to take at the look at the process we can take to achieve this effect:

- [ ] Step 1 - create a 2 columns grid
- [ ] Step 2 - set a height to the columns
- [ ] Step 3 - remove the spacing
- [ ] Step 4 - clean up the code
  - Remove color classes that enable easy visualization of the elements added and changed

Because I absolutely *detest* carousels, I am totally skipping all this nonsense!

# Page 7: [Material Minimal](https://mdbootstrap.com/learn/mdb-foundations/mdb-ui-kit/material-minimal/)

- *"Material Minimal"* is *"an improved version"* of Google's Classic Material Design
  - See below for more about Google's Classic Material Design
- *"Material Minimal"* is the *MDB Design system*

> A design system is a set of standards to manage design at scale by reducing redundancy while creating a shared language and visual consistency across different pages and channels - Therese Fessenden

## Classic Material Design

- *"Material is the metaphor"*
- *"Material Design is inspired by the physical world and its textures"*
- *"Material surfaces reimagine the mediums of paper and ink"*
- With [Material Design Version 3](https://m3.material.io/), Google moved to *"put people at the center"*

## About Material Minimal

- Material Minimal's core values are:
  - Natural - *"inspired by the physical world"*
  - Clear - *"needs to breathe"*
  - Scalable - *"grows with your project"*

This inspires a list of *"some of its most important priniciples"*, which appear in this subsection of the page.

## Accessibility and usefulness

When creating each and every element, the designer should consider this question:

> "Is this really helpful to the user? Or is it just to satisfy my vanity and need for artistic expression?"

## Hierarchy

The user should be able to quickly identify which elements on a page are the most important.

> "Remember: there should be only one key action in a given view, represented, for example, by a primary button. Never use more than 1 primary button in a given view, otherwise you will confuse your user."

> "The secondary and tetiary buttons, however, can appear many times (but be careful not to overdo them as well)."

## Contrast

> "Material Minimal strictly follows Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)"

- This section includes link to a [contrast measurement tool](https://contrast-ratio.com/#%23285192-on-%23d7e3f4)

**TODO:** Check out this tool someday!!

## Shadows

- Shadows are more subtle in Material Minimal than they are in Classic Material Design
  - You can use a five point scale to specify the intensity
  - The default is level 4

## Roundings

Rounded corners are pleasing to the eye and make elements more organic and friendly.

## Whitespace

Whitespace around elements give them *"room to breathe."*

- MDB provides extra scale for the bottom margin of elements
  - [For more click here](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/utilities/spacing/#section-extra-scale-for-the-bottom-margin)

## Details

- Good use of Hierarchy allows the User to find what's relevant quickly, while still having plenty of details if that's what they want

## Photos

- Photos can enhance a site's **naturalness**

## Effects

- Effects should be subtle
- For example, hover effects include
  - Overlay - hovering the mouse blurs the image slightly
  - Zoom - hovering the mouse gives the user a slightly closer look
  - Shadow - hovering the mouse adds a shadow, making the photo appear to rise

## Detailed specification

Material Minimal is fully mature and well-documented.

# Page 8: [Nested flexbox](https://mdbootstrap.com/learn/mdb-foundations/mdb-ui-kit/nested-flexbox/)

- **Important notes:**
  - *"Flexbox"* means using the `.d-flex` class
  - To include more than one element inside a flexbox, use an enclosing `<div class="">`
- The last tutorial used flexbox to create a call to action or *"CTA"*
- This tutorial will use flexbox to create a complex layout
  - This complex layout will contain at least one CTA
  - It also requires adding multiple flexboxes, one inside another
- Flexbox can help center content in a column
- This feature of MDB also includes a `.flex-column` class
  - Not really diving into details here...
- Links to more information:
  - [Flexbox documentation page](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/layout/flexbox/))
  - [Flexbox generator](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/tools/builders/flexbox/)

> "For complex concepts such as nested flexbox, there is no better way to consolidate knowledge than simply experimenting."

# Page 9: [Sticky navbar](https://mdbootstrap.com/learn/mdb-foundations/mdb-ui-kit/sticky-navbar/)

- The term *"sticky"* refers to the fact that this nav bar will remain visible at the top of the screen even when the user scrolls down
  - To make something *"stick"* to the top of the page, use the class `.fixed-top`
  - To make something *"stick"* to the bottom of the page, use the class `.fixed-bottom`
- For other ways to position things and make them sticky, see:
  - [MDB position utilities](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/utilities/position/)

# Page 10: [Logo](https://mdbootstrap.com/learn/mdb-foundations/mdb-ui-kit/logo/)

I won't be doing this, but it's interesting to see the steps in the process:

- [ ] Step 1 - use the [Logo generator page](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/tools/design/logo-generator/) to create a logo
- [ ] Step 2 - take a screenshot
- [ ] Step 3 - cut out the background
  - The tutorial recommends using the [photopea site](https://www.photopea.com/) to do this
- [ ] Step 4 - compress your logo
- [ ] Step 5 - add logo to the navbar

Interesting!

# Page 11: [Animated navbar](https://mdbootstrap.com/learn/mdb-foundations/mdb-ui-kit/animated-navbar/)

- Shows how to cause the color of a navbar to change when the user scrolls down on the page
- Good to know this is possible, but I am not interested in diving into how it works right now!
- **TODO:** check this out, if I decide to do it

# Page 12: [Cascading cards](https://mdbootstrap.com/learn/mdb-foundations/mdb-ui-kit/cascading-cards/)

- The term *"cascading"* refers to making the photo in a card appear *above* the card's top border
  - This is done by adding a *negative top margin* to the images
    - That is in turn done by adding an **`n`** to one of the `mt-*` margin-top classes, e.g., `mt-n1`
    - In this case, they use `mt-n3`
  - TBH I did not notice this effect the first time I looked at the page
    - Indeed it is so subtle as to be barely noticalble, even though now I know to look for it!

Although I want to stay focused on the end goal here and not get bogged down,
I feel it is worthwhile to examine the steps used in this process.

- [ ] Step 1 - add an empty "My projects" section
- [ ] Step 2 - add grid with 3 columns
- [ ] Step 3 - add a card to each column
- [ ] Step 4 - customize the content of the cards
- [ ] Step 5 - add a margin to the image
- [ ] Step 6 - add shadows and roundings
- [ ] Step 7 - add a negative margin
- [ ] Step 8 - align card heights and rounding

Overall, the process proceeds from top-level elements to the finer details of the smaller elements,
essentially proceding from general to specific.
