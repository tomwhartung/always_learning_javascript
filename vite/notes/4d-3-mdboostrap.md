For details, see that file.

At the very end of this page, the tutorial recommends renaming this directory, so that is what I will do:

```
$ pwd
/var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/vite/projects/4-my_mdb_adventure/4c-mdb_cli-mdbootstrap
$ mv mdb5-free-standard mdb-uikit-tutorial
$ gs .

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
$ git add mdb-uikit-tutorial/

# Page 4: [Create a Portfolio](https://mdbootstrap.com/learn/mdb-foundations/mdb-ui-kit/create-portfolio/)

- [x] Visited link to demo we will be creating: [ascensus-mdb-uikit-tutorial.mdbgo.io](https://ascensus-mdb-uikit-tutorial.mdbgo.io/)
- [x] Added basic structure code to `index.html`

# Page 5: [Split screen](https://mdbootstrap.com/learn/mdb-foundations/mdb-ui-kit/split-screen/)

I am not going to go through these steps, but I think it is worthwhile to take at the look at the process we can take to achieve this effect:

- [ ] Step 1 - create a 2 columns grid
- [ ] Step 2 - set a height to the columns
- [ ] Step 3 - remove the spacing
- [ ] Step 4 - clean up the code
  - Remove color classes that enable easy visualization of the elements added and changed

# Page 6: [Half carousel](https://mdbootstrap.com/learn/mdb-foundations/mdb-ui-kit/half-carousel/)

Because I absolutely *detest* carousels, I am totally skipping all this nonsense!

# Page 7: [Material Minimal](https://mdbootstrap.com/learn/mdb-foundations/mdb-ui-kit/material-minimal/)

- *"Material Minimal"* is *"an improved version"* of Google's Classic Material Design
  - See below for more about Google's Classic Material Design
- *"Material Minimal"* is the *MDB Design system*

> A design system is a set of standards to manage design at scale by reducing redundancy while creating a shared language and visual consistency across different pages and channels - Therese Fessenden

## Classic Material Design

- *"Material is the metaphor"*
- *"Material Design is inspired by the physical world and its textures"*
- *"Material surfaces reimagine the mediums of paper and ink"*
- With [Material Design Version 3](https://m3.material.io/), Google moved to *"put people at the center"*

## About Material Minimal

- Material Minimal's core values are:
  - Natural - *"inspired by the physical world"*
  - Clear - *"needs to breathe"*
  - Scalable - *"grows with your project"*

This inspires a list of *"some of its most important priniciples"*, which appear in this subsection of the page.

## Accessibility and usefulness

When creating each and every element, the designer should consider this question:

> "Is this really helpful to the user? Or is it just to satisfy my vanity and need for artistic expression?"

## Hierarchy

The user should be able to quickly identify which elements on a page are the most important.
