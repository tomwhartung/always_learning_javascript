Some notes from reading the first page of the handbook, i.e.,
[The Basics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/basic-types.html).

# 1. The JS `typeof` operator and Dynamic Typing

The JS `typeof` operator allows us to identify primitive types like `string` and `number`,
but it provides no information when it comes to functions, objects, etc.

In other words, JS provides only *dynamic typing* done at run time.
To help predict what code will do *before* then we need *static typing.*
