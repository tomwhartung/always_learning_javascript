This is the `README.md` file for the `typescript/notes/2-typescriptlang` directory in the
`always_learning_javascript` repository.

This directory contains the notes I am taking while going through the
[TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).

# 1. TypeScript for JS Programmers

The notes in `01-typescript_for_js_programmers.md` are from
[typescript_for_js_programmers](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html).

# 2. The Basics

The notes in `02-the_basics.md` are from
[The Basics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/basic-types.html).

# 3. The Rest of the Handbook

The rest of the files in this directory contain notes for each of the pages in the rest of the TS Handbook.
