# typescript/README.md

This is the `README.md` file for the `typescript` directory in the `always_learning_javascript` repository.

# Learning TypeScript

The plan is to:

1. Try the online tutorial at [w3schools.com](https://w3schools.com)
2. Find more information in the [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
3. Check out the information in the section *TypeScript in React* of the *Road to React* e-book
4. Try it out for realzies with react and vite
5. Try it out for realzies with react, vite, and mdb

# Directories With Code

Hopefully by the time I get through the above steps, I will be ready to work on my Visualizing Personalities project!

- Look for actual TS code, set up using `npm`, in the `typescript/projects/` directory
- Look for more TS code, set up using `vite`, in the `vite/` directory
- Look for prototype code for my visualizing personalities project using TS, react, vite ... **TBD**

# 1. W3schools.com Online Tutorial

The `typescript/notes/1-w3schools/` directory has notes from the w3schools tutorial.

# 2. TypeScriptlang.org Docs

The `typescript/notes/2-typescriptlang/` directory has notes gleaned from
the [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).

# 3. TypeScript and React

The `typescript/projects/` directory has code using:

- 0-my-test_tsc - just typescript without react, i.e. using `tsc`

# 4. Using TypeScript, React and Vite

The `vite/` directory has:

- 1. Code inspired by the *Road to React* e-book
- 2. A lot of projects that use TypeScript

# 5. Using TypeScript, React, Vite, and MDB

When I tried this page:

- [MDB 5 Vite Integration](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/getting-started/vite-integration/)

I found that I could not get vite, react, and mdb to work together.  Rats!

# 6. Finding the Best Compromise

The `whole_shebang/` directory is where I am planning to put code using as many of these components as possible.

- Unfortunately, at this time it looks like we will need to forego using vite
