This is the `README.md` file for the `typescript` directory in the `always_learning_javascript` repository.

# Learning Typescript

The plan is to:

2. Find more information in the [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
3. Check out the information in the section *TypeScript in React* of the *Road to React* e-book
4. Try it out for realzies with react and vite
5. Try it out for realzies with react, vite, and mdb

# Directories With Code

Hopefully by the time I get through the above steps, I will be ready to work on my Visualizing Personalities project!

- Look for actual TS code, set up using `npm`, in the `typescript/projects/` directory
- Look for more TS code, set up using `vite`, in the `vite/` directory
- Look for prototype code for my visualizing personalities project using TS, react, vite ... **TBD**
