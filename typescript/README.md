# README.md

This is the `README.md` file for the `typescript` directory in the `always_learning_javascript` repository.

# 1. Learning Typescript

The plan is to try one or a few online tutorials, then try it out for realzies with react.

## 1.1. Online Tutorials

- First try the [one at w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/index.php)
- Then look at the [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) to see where to go next

## 1.2. Typescript and React

Look at the section *TypeScript in React* in the *React Maintenance* chapter of the *Road to React* e-book.

## 1.3. Typescript, React, and MDB

Try this page:

- [MDB 5 Vite Integration](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/getting-started/vite-integration/)

# 2. Using Typescript

Hopefully by the time I get through the above steps, I will be ready to work on my Visualizing Personalities project!
