This is the `README.md` file for the `whole_shebang` directory in the `always_learning_javascript` repository.

# 1. The Whole Shebang

The plan is to get to where I can start a new project with all of these components working together:

- Reactjs
- Vite
- ESLint
- TypeScript
- MDB

For a list of commands I can run to initialize a minimal "Hello world"-type project with these components, see:

- `./1-whole_shebang-commands.md`
