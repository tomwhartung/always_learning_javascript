The plan is to get to where I can easily start a new project with all of these components working together:

- Reactjs
- Vite
- ESLint
- TypeScript
- MDB

# Projects

- [x] Project 1 - The Whole Shebang With Cruft
  - Goal:
    - Get just the components above downloaded and installed
  - Notes:
    - `whole_shebang/notes/1-whole_shebang.md`
  - Project:
    - `whole_shebang/projects/1-whole_shebang`
  - Results:
    - Assembled a list of commands that initialize a "Hello world"-type project with the key components
    - **Did *not* delete cruft**
      - For a cruftless "Hello World" project see Project 5: `whole_shebang/notes/5-whole_shebang_no_cruft.md`

- [x] Project 2 - The Whole Shebang With (`wsw_`) Graphics
  - Goal:
    - [x] Single page with simple canvas
  - References:
    - `mdn/projects/5-the_simplest_canvas` in the `always_learning_computer_graphics` repo
  - Notes:
    - `whole_shebang/notes/2-wsw_graphics`
  - Project:
    - `whole_shebang/projects/2-wsw_graphics`
  - Results:
    - Straightforward, but got two warnings in VSCode that I did not get when working on `5-the_simplest_canvas`
      - The warnings were very easy to fix

- [x] Project 3 - The Whole Shebang With (`wsw_`) Sliders
  - Goal:
    - [x] Single page with sliders controlling a canvas
  - References:
    - `mdn/projects/4-canvas_with_sliders` in the `always_learning_computer_graphics` repo
  - Notes:
    - `whole_shebang/notes/3-wsw_sliders`
  - Project:
    - `whole_shebang/projects/3-wsw_sliders`
  - Results:
    - Really just copied the code from the following project and it worked ok:
      - `mdn/projects/4-canvas_with_sliders` in the `always_learning_computer_graphics` repo

- [x] Project 4 - The Whole Shebang With (`wsw_`) Navbar
  - Goal:
    - [x] Figure out how I want to use Navbars in my new site
      - Technically speaking, this was accomplished in Project 9 under `mdbootstrap`
      - The *"real"* goal of this project is to put all that in a more accessible place
      - For details, see `mdbootstrap/notes/9c-wsw_navbar-two_navbars.md`
  - References:
    - Source of raw html & documentation about how it works is here:
      - https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/navigation/navbar/
    - Project 9 in the `mdbootstrap` directory in this repo
      - `mdbootstrap/notes/9a-wsw_navbar-in_index_html.md`
      - `mdbootstrap/projects/9a-wsw_navbar-in_index_html`
      - `mdbootstrap/notes/9b-wsw_navbar-in_main_tsx.md`
      - `mdbootstrap/projects/9b-wsw_navbar-in_main_tsx`
      - **`mdbootstrap/notes/9c-wsw_navbar-two_navbars.md`**
      - **`mdbootstrap/projects/9c-wsw_navbar-two_navbars`**
  - Notes:
    - `whole_shebang/notes/4-wsw_navbar.md`
  - Project:
    - `whole_shebang/projects/4-wsw_navbar`
  - Results:
    - After starting this project, I got sidetracked into working on Project 9 under `mdbootstrap`
    - After some deliberation and experimentation, it became clear that I would want to use two types of Navbars
    - This project is really just a copy of the `9c-wsw_navbar-two_navbars` project under `mdbootstrap`

- [x] Project 5 - The Whole Shebang "Hello world"-type App
  - Goal:
    - Download and install the components above and delete cruft
  - Notes:
    - `whole_shebang/notes/5-whole_shebang_no_cruft.md`
  - Project:
    - `whole_shebang/projects/5-whole_shebang_no_cruft`
  - Results:
    - Assembled a list of commands that initialize a "Hello world"-type project with the key components
