The plan is to get to where I can easily start a new project with all of these components working together:

- Reactjs
- Vite
- ESLint
- TypeScript
- MDB

# Projects

- [x] Project 1 - The Whole Shebang With Cruft
  - Goal:
    - Get just the components above downloaded and installed
  - Notes:
    - `whole_shebang/notes/1-whole_shebang.md`
  - Project:
    - `whole_shebang/projects/1-whole_shebang`
  - Results:
    - Assembled a list of commands that initialize a "Hello world"-type project with the key components
    - **Did *not* delete cruft**
      - For a cruftless "Hello World" project see Project 5: `whole_shebang/notes/5-whole_shebang_no_cruft.md`

- [x] Project 2 - The Whole Shebang With (`wsw_`) Graphics
  - Goal:
    - [x] Single page with simple canvas
  - References:
    - `mdn/projects/5-the_simplest_canvas` in the `always_learning_computer_graphics` repo
  - Notes:
    - `whole_shebang/notes/2-wsw_graphics`
  - Project:
    - `whole_shebang/projects/2-wsw_graphics`
  - Results:
    - Straightforward, but got two warnings in VSCode that I did not get when working on `5-the_simplest_canvas`
      - The warnings were very easy to fix

- [x] Project 3 - The Whole Shebang With (`wsw_`) Sliders
  - Goal:
    - [x] Single page with sliders controlling a canvas
  - References:
    - `mdn/projects/4-canvas_with_sliders` in the `always_learning_computer_graphics` repo
  - Notes:
    - `whole_shebang/notes/3-wsw_sliders`
  - Project:
    - `whole_shebang/projects/3-wsw_sliders`
  - Results:
    - Really just copied the code from the following project and it worked ok:
      - `mdn/projects/4-canvas_with_sliders` in the `always_learning_computer_graphics` repo

- [ ] Project 4 - The Whole Shebang With (`wsw_`) Navbar
