**Hoped-for behavior**

I would like to use MDB, React and Vite (as well as TypeScript) together.

**Actual behavior**

I have learned how to use MDB CLI to get MDB + React and MDB + Vite, but have not yet figured out how to get all three.

Am I missing something obvious? Is there a way to get all three manually?

**Resources (screenshots, code snippets etc.)**

1.  Run mdb init
2.  Scroll through the list
3.  Find React, and Standard + Vite, but I cannot find both together

Thanks in advance for any assistance anyone can offer!

Unfortunately, we do not have a ready-made starter for MDB React + Vite at the moment. But you can do it easily.
Execute the command:
  npm init vite@latest -- --template react-ts
and add the MDB React, e.g. with npm:
  npm i mdb-react-ui-kit
