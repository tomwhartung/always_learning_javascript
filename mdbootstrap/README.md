Convinced I need to use MDB + React.

*Unfortunately,* it looks like this means passing on vite - at least for now.  Rats!

# Goal of This Directory

- The purpose of this directory is to test if I can still use TypeScript and Lint.

# To Find Much, Much More About MDB

Most of my notes about MDB, including notes for most of the tutorials on the site, are:

- In the `vite` directory, in the `vite/notes/4*` files
- **Why?**
  - Unfortunately, after going through all that, I assumed that:
    - Since I can use MDB + Vite
    - And I can use MDB + React
    - That I can use MDB + React + Vite
  - Unfortunately, that assumption proved to be **wrong!**  **Rats!!**
