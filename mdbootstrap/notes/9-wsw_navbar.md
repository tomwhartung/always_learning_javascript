This file contains information that is common to both of these projects:

- `9a-wsw_navbar-in_index_html.md`
- `9b-wsw_navbar-in_main_tsx.md`

# 1. Goal

- [ ] Decide whether it is best to add the navbar code to `index.html` or `src/main.tsx`

# 2. Process

- Step 1. Create two projects that are identical *except* the file in which we place the navbar code
  - `9a-wsw_navbar-in_index_html.md` - puts the navbar code in `index.html`
  - `9b-wsw_navbar-in_main_tsx.md` - puts the navbar code in `src/main.tsx`
- Step 2. Create a list of "pros" for each project
  - Note that the "pros" for one project are essentially "cons" for the other project
    - In other words, adding "cons" would be redundant!
- Step 3. Review these lists and make a decision

# 3. General Notes



# 4. "Pros" of Putting the Navbar in `index.html`

This section lists reasons we would want to use `9a-wsw_navbar-in_index_html.md` *instead of* `9b-wsw_navbar-in_main_tsx.md`.

- The example contains no React code, so why bother to use it?

# 5. "Pros" of Putting the Navbar in `src/main.tsx`

This section lists reasons we would want to use `9b-wsw_navbar-in_main_tsx.md` *instead of* `9a-wsw_navbar-in_index_html.md`.

- If we want to use React code in the navbar, then it needs to go in `src/main.tsx`
