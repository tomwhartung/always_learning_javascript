import "@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all.min.css";
```

#### 2.2.1.4. Roboto font

Adding this line between the `<head>` and `</head>` tags in `public/index.html`:

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet" />
```

Adding these lines to the top of `src/index.css`:

```
body {
  font-family: Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

### 2.2.2. Step 2 - Launch App

```
npm start
```

### 2.2.3. VSCode Check

Everything looks ok!

# 3. Assessment

- Looks like a regular React app
- Seeing eslint in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
- Seeing typescript in `package-lock.json`

## 3.1. Relevant Files

These are files that I *might* want to change when writing my app:

- `public/index.html`
- `src/App.css`
- `src/App.js`
- `src/index.css`
- `src/index.js`

I could be wrong, but it seems like sometimes I don't see all of these....

### 3.1.1. What, No `.jsx` Files?

Why are there no `.jsx` files?

## 3.2. Sanity Checks

- [x] Edit `src/App.js` to say "Hi"
- [x] Test Linting
  - Add this line to `src/App.js`:
    -`const test_linting = 'Test Linting';`
  - [x] Check for warning in VSCode
  - [x] Check for warning in terminal running `npm start`
