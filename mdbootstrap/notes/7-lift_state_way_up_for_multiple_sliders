# 7-lift_state_way_up_for_multiple_sliders.md

Lifting state up two levels for an array of components - as begun in `6-get_multiple_MySliders_to_work.md`, proved to be extremely challenging.

- In this project we *divide and conquer* by breaking the task in Project 6 down into *"baby steps"*

**Note:** this file was originally named `7-lift_state_up_for_a_single_slider.md`.

# 1. Setup

The code for this project is in:

- `mdbootstrap/projects/7a-lift_state_up-single_slider-one_level`
- `mdbootstrap/projects/7b-lift_state_up-single_slider-two_levels`
- `mdbootstrap/projects/7c-lsup-array_of_numbers`
  - **This is the *best-so-far* version**
- `mdbootstrap/projects/7d-lsup-array_of_objects`
  - Abandoned this version due to:
    - Code compiles but gets a browser error
    - Not seeing a reason to persist down this path at this time
    - Ready to move on

## 1.1. Commands

### 1.1.1. What Is the Truth??

**Note:** although this project was originally named `7-lift_state_up_for_a_single_slider`,
it was later renamed to `7a-lift_state_up-single_slider-one_level`.

- The commands in `7a-lift_state_up-single_slider-one_level.md` tell one story ...
- ... and the output of running `gredt` for `7-lift_state_up_for_a_single_slider` tells another:

```
$ gredt 7-lift_state_up_for_a_single_slider
Searching for "7-lift_state_up_for_a_single_slider" in files under "/var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/mdbootstrap"
. . .
. . .
. . .
projects/7a-lift_state_up-single_slider-one_level/node_modules/.package-lock.json:2:  "name": "7-lift_state_up_for_a_single_slider",
projects/7a-lift_state_up-single_slider-one_level/package-lock.json:2:  "name": "7-lift_state_up_for_a_single_slider",
projects/7a-lift_state_up-single_slider-one_level/package-lock.json:8:      "name": "7-lift_state_up_for_a_single_slider",
projects/7a-lift_state_up-single_slider-one_level/package.json:2:  "name": "7-lift_state_up_for_a_single_slider",
$
```

In this case, I don't thing we need to worry too much about *The Truth,* because it's time to move on!

### 1.1.2. Project Setup - Before Renaming Things

All of these sub-projects are set up similarly, by running these commands:

```
pwd                                            # /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/mdbootstrap/projects
                                               # Start with vite
npm init vite@latest -- --template react-ts    # *Note:* set project name to "7-lift_state_up_for_a_single_slider"

cd 7-lift_state_up_for_a_single_slider         # /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/mdbootstrap/projects/7-lift_state_up_for_a_single_slider
npm i mdb-react-ui-kit                         # Add mdb and react
npm run dev                                    # Start development server; press "q" to quit
```

**Note:** the `7-lift_state_up_for_a_single_slider` was later renamed to `7a-lift_state_up-single_slider-one_level`,
because that turned out to be a major project!

## 1.2. Add `mdb.min.css` to `index.html`:

Add the code in the following code box to inside the `<head>...</head>` element in `index.html`:

```
<!-- MDB -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/node_modules/mdb-react-ui-kit/dist/css/mdb.min.css" />
```

**Note:** if this is the only change made to the installed version of `index.html` in `6-get_multiple_MySliders_to_work`,
then just copy that file over.

```
$ pwd
/var/www/always_learning/always_learning_javascript/mdbootstrap/projects
$ diff 6-get_multiple_MySliders_to_work/index.html 7-lift_state_up_for_a_single_slider/index.html
7,8d6
<     <!-- MDB -->
<     <link rel="stylesheet" href="/node_modules/mdb-react-ui-kit/dist/css/mdb.min.css" />
$ cp 6-get_multiple_MySliders_to_work/index.html 7-lift_state_up_for_a_single_slider/index.html
$ diff 6-get_multiple_MySliders_to_work/index.html 7-lift_state_up_for_a_single_slider/index.html
$
```

**As noted last time:** We may want to add Font Awesome, Google Fonts Roboto, and maybe others.

# 2. Sanity Checks

- [x] Check in browser at http://localhost:5173/
- [x] Load into VSCode
- [x] Run `npm run lint`

# 3. Process

## 3.0. Overview

- [x] Step 3.1. Remove all but one card from `MyContainer`
- [x] Step 3.2. Lift state up for just the one card from `MySlider` to `MySliderCard`
- [x] Step 3.3. Lift state up for just the one card again from `MySliderCard` to `MyComponent`
- [x] Step 3.4. Figure out how to put the new tag for `MySliderCard` in a loop
- [!] Step 3.5. Lift State Up Two Levels for Multiple Sliders Using an Array of Objects

## 3.1. Details for Step 3.1.

In this step we remove all but one card from `MyContainer`.

- In this case, the details are really not worth mentioning

## 3.2. Details for Step 3.2.

In this step we work on lifting state up for a single slider just one level.

- Details are in `7a-lift_state_up-single_slider-one_level.md`

## 3.3. Details for Step 3.3.

In this step we work on lifting state up for a single slider an additional level.

- Details are in `7b-lift_state_up-single_slider-two_levels.md`

## 3.4. Details for Step 3.4.

In this step we work on being able to lift state up multiple levels for multiple sliders using an array of numbers
as the state variable.

- Ultimately figured out how to create multiple sliders in a `for` loop
- Details are in `7c-lsup-array_of_numbers.md`

## 3.5. Details for Step 3.5.

In this step we work on being able to lift state up multiple levels for multiple sliders using an array of objects
as the state variable.

- Decided to abandon this project!
- Details are in `7c-lsup-array_of_numbers.md`
