# 4-mdb_ts_eslint_react-find_the_best_process.md

The process suggested by support, as noted in `3-suggested_by_support.md`, looks like the best so far.

How can I be sure?

# 1. Advantages of the `3-suggested_by_support.md` Process

- File extensions are correct
  - No need to rename files, which can break stuff
- Includes a `.gitignore`
  - Not sure why the other bundles installed by running `mdb init` don't include this
- `vite` beats `npm`

# 2. Disadvantages of the `3-suggested_by_support.md` Process

- Takes two steps instead of just the one
  - Yeah that is a bfd, *not!*
- Almost seems to be too easy
  - ;-)
