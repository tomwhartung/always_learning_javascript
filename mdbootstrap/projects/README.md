# mdbootstrap/projects/README.md

This is the `README.md` file for the `mdbootstrap/projects/` directory.

**Note: Please do not use this file!!**

I had a similar file in the `typescript/projects` directory and it led to a lot of redundancy
which caused issues when things changed and then I was distracted by the Reactathon.

- Also, it's looking like I will be will be working on this and the `../notes` directory in parallel

So please, update `../README.md` but **leave this file alone!!**
