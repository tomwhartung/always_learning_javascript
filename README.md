# 1. Origins

About how this repo got started.

## `nodeschool` and `codecademy`

Checking in my codecademy and nodeschool code to make it easy to pick up where I left off on another computer, should I decide to do so.

* The codecademy site is at [codecademy.com](http://codecademy.com/).

* The nodeschool site is at [nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io/).

## Node School Workshoppers

See the [nodeschool README](https://github.com/tomwhartung/always_learning_javascript/blob/master/nodeschool/README.md).

# 2. `stateofjs` and `reactjs`

Came back to this repo when I definitively decided to learn React.

I made the decision to learn React largely because most of the developers who answered the
[2022 stateofjs survey](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-us/)
agreed it was one worth learning and using again.

# 3. `typescript` and `vite`

Before starting on my groja project, I want to learn Typescript and Vite, and then add in Material Design Bootstrap [mdb]:

- The *Road to React* book I bought recommends using Vite
  - The section about typescript in the *Road to React* book shows how to use Vite to get started with Typescript
- Here are a couple of sites that agree that it's better than `create-react-app` or CRA:
  - [Vite & Webpack: Pros & Cons](https://synergycodes.com/blog/vite-a-worthy-successor-to-webpack-pros-and-cons-of-both-solutions/)
  - [4 Reasons to Prefer Vite over Webpack](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/vite)
- Vite won three awards in the [2022 stateofjs survey - awards page](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/awards/)
  - Most Adopted Technology
  - Highest Retention
  - Highest Interest
- Typescript was also popular with the people who answered the [2022 stateofjs survey](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-us/)
  - See *Javascript Flavors* on the [2022 stateofjs other tools page](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/other-tools/)
- MDB shows how to use Vite integrate it into a project:
  - [MDB 5 Vite Integration](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/getting-started/vite-integration/)
